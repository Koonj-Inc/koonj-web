### Be excellent

- Assume good intent, especially around translation work or design choices.
- Raise concerns directly and calmly—issues are easier to resolve with facts and empathy.

### Inclusions

- Celebrate the bilingual nature of this project by avoiding assumptions about language ability.
- Use respectful language when referencing teams, regions, or cultures.
- Avoid off-topic signaling or personal attacks in issues or PRs.

### Consequences
