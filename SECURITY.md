## Security Policy

### Reporting a vulnerability

To report a security issue, please email `security@koonj.ir` with:

- A concise description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce, ideally with a minimal reproduction (code or screens).
- The version of the site (`master` branch as of the latest deploy) and the environment (e.g., production on Liara).

If you can’t email, open a private issue titled **Security report** and we will respond within 3 business days.

### Supported versions

- This repository tracks the latest production-ready marketing site and does not maintain a long version history. Apply patches to `master`, run `npm run lint`, and trigger a manual Liara deployment once merged.

### Handling requests

We will acknowledge a valid report within 24 hours, provide a CVE (if applicable), and credit the reporter unless otherwise requested. Urgent or disruptive reports may trigger an out-of-band call.
